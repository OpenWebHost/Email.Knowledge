>## How Sender Policy Framework (SPF) works
>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) was the first real attempt at an email authentication protocol, devised in the early 2000, SPF utilizes a Domain Name System (DNS) TXT record to specify which email sources are valid email senders for the given domain and what to do with the messages that don’t originate from those sources. It acts as a digital bouncer; if you aren’t cool enough to be on the list, you’re likely to get kicked to the curb (or land in the spam folder).
